We propose a novel prostate cancer detector that can operate in the absence of MR imaging sequences. Our novel prostate cancer detector ﬁrst trains a forest of random ferns on all MR sequences and then decomposes these random ferns into a sum of MR sequence-speciﬁc random ferns enabling predictions to be made in the absence of one or more of these MR sequences. To accomplish this, we ﬁrst show that a sum of random ferns can be exactly represented by another random fern and then we propose a method to approximately decompose an arbitrary random fern into a sum of random ferns. We show that our decomposed detector can maintain good performance when some MR sequences are omitted.},

We report on the development of a convolution neural network (CNN) model to support CADx in PCa based on the appearance of prostate tissue in mpMRI, conducted as part of the SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx challenge. The performance of different combinations of mpMRI inputs to CNN was assessed and the best result was achieved using DWI and DCE-MRI modalities together with the zonal information of the finding. On the test set, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80.},

A physical interpretation of the proposed CAD system is given, and its block diagram is constructed.

	abstract = {Deep learning is considered as a popular and powerful method in pattern recognition and classification. However, there are not many deep structured applications used in medical imaging diagnosis area, because large dataset is not always available for medical images. In this study we tested the feasibility of using deep learning algorithms for lung cancer diagnosis with the cases from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) database. The nodules on each computed tomography (CT) slice were segmented according to marks provided by the radiologists. After down sampling and rotating we acquired 174412 samples with 52 by 52 pixel each and the corresponding truth files. Three deep learning algorithms were designed and implemented, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE). To compare the performance of deep learning algorithms with traditional computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system, we designed a scheme with 28 image features and support vector machine. The accuracies of CNN, DBNs, and SDAE are 0.7976, 0.8119, and 0.7929, respectively; the accuracy of our designed traditional CADx is 0.7940, which is slightly lower than CNN and DBNs. We also noticed that the mislabeled nodules using DBNs are 4\% larger than using traditional CADx, this might be resulting from down sampling process lost some size information of the nodules.},

It covers from the genesis of neural networks when associationism modeling of the brain is studied, to the models that dominate the last decade of research in deep learning like convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks, and recurrent neural networks. In addition to a review of these models, this paper primarily focuses on the precedents of the models above, examining how the initial ideas are assembled to construct the early models and how these preliminary models are developed into their current forms. Many of these evolutionary paths last more than half a century and have a diversity of directions. For example, CNN is built on prior knowledge of biological vision system; DBN is evolved from a trade-oﬀ of modeling power and computation complexity of graphical models and many nowadays models are neural counterparts of ancient linear models. This paper reviews these evolutionary paths and oﬀers a concise thought ﬂow of how these models are developed, and aims to provide a thorough background for deep learning. More importantly, along with the path, this paper summarizes the gist behind these milestones and proposes many directions to guide the future research of deep learning.},

This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based transfer learning approach to classify the brain MRI scans into two classes using three pre-trained models. The performances of these models are compared with each other. Experimental results show that the Resnet-50 model achieves the highest accuracy and least false negative rates as 95\% and zero respectively. It is followed by VGG-16 and Inception-V3 model with an accuracy of 90\% and 55\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Brain Cancer is one of the most dangerous problems today. Brain Tumor is controlled growth of cancerous or non-cancerous unhealthy cells in the brain. In the present world brain tumor are a very dangerous disease and the main reason for many deaths. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is mostly used the medical image for the brain tumor analysis. The main objective of the paper is to classify the brain tumor various stages using Convolutional Neural Network algorithmbased on Brain MRI images. Brain tumor analysis is done with the help of Convolutional Neural Network and the work is also compared with another popular machine learning classifier like Random Forest and K Nearest Neighbors. During the comparison, the Convolutional Neural Network is considered as one of the best classifiers for classifying the various stages of a brain tumor. The average accuracy of the brain tumor classification with the help of Convolutional Neural Network classifier is 98\% with cross-entropy is 0.097 and validation accuracy is 71\% so the Convolutional Neural Network is found to be one of the efficient methods for performing different stages of brain tumor classification.},

End-to-end training was performed for XmasNet, with data augmentation done through 3D rotation and slicing, in order to incorporate the 3D information of the lesion. XmasNet outperformed traditional machine learning models based on engineered features, for both train and test data. For the test data, XmasNet outperformed 69 methods from 33 participating groups and achieved the second highest AUC (0.84) in the PROSTATEx challenge. This study shows the great potential of deep learning for cancer imaging.},

Investigators have been encouraged to publish their clinical and imaging data as part of fulfilling their grant obligations. Realizing it was not sufficient to merely ask investigators to publish their collection of imaging and clinical data, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created the open source National Biomedical Image Archive software package as a mechanism for centralized hosting of cancer related imaging. NCI has contracted with Washington University in Saint Louis to create The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)—an open-source, open-access information resource to support research, development, and educational initiatives utilizing advanced medical imaging of cancer. In its first year of operation, TCIA accumulated 23 collections (3.3 million images). Operating and maintaining a high-availability image archive is a complex challenge involving varied archive-specific resources and driven by the needs of both image submitters and image consumers. Quality archives of any type (traditional library, PubMed, refereed journals) require management and customer service. This paper describes the management tasks and user support model for TCIA.},
